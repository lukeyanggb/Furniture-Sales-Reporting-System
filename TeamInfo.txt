* SQL queries are implemented in `app.py` file in root directory. You can easily find them as `query` variables in FLASK View functions.
Example in `category_report` View function: 
----------------
query = \
"""
SELECT G.category_name as cat_name,
    Count(*) as count,
    Min(G.regular_price) as min,
    cast(Avg(G.regular_price) as DECIMAL(9,2)) as avg,
    Max(G.regular_price) as max
FROM   (SELECT T.category_name,
            P.regular_price
        FROM   (SELECT C.category_name,
                    I.productid
                FROM   category AS C
                    LEFT JOIN incategory AS I
                            ON C.category_name = I.category_name) AS T
            LEFT JOIN product AS P
                    ON T.productid = P.productid) AS G
GROUP  BY category_name
ORDER  BY G.category_name ASC;
